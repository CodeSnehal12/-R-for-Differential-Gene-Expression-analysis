-R-for-Differential-Gene-Expression-analysis
Description:
This repository contains code and analysis for performing a comprehensive exploration of gene expression data using R. Led by Snehal Ashok Kanase, the analysis focuses on understanding the impact of fetal sex and tobacco smoke exposure on gene expression patterns. The repository includes detailed steps for importing microarray data into R, filtering genes based on expression levels or other criteria, conducting statistical tests for differential expression analysis, and visualizing results using heatmaps.

Additionally, the repository provides insights into the biological implications of the differentially expressed genes in the context of fetal sex and tobacco smoke exposure. The analysis covers the identification of significantly differentially expressed genes, visualization of differential expression results through volcano plots, and discussion of potential biological implications.

With Snehal Ashok Kanase's expertise in R programming and bioinformatics, this repository serves as a valuable resource for researchers and analysts interested in exploring gene expression data and understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying complex biological phenomena.
